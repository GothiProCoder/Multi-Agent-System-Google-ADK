🎯 Goal:
  Find the next SpaceX launch, check weather at that location,
  then summarize if it may be delayed.

🧠 Planner Order:

🔍 Agent Outputs:
  1. launches_agent:
     “Launch Information Fetched Successfully”
  2. weather_agent:
     “Weather Information fetched successfully”
  3. summarizer_agent (final_response):
     “SpaceX is scheduled to launch a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket
      carrying a batch of 27 Starlink satellites (Group 10-23)
      on June 23, 2025, from Cape Canaveral SFS, FL, USA.  
      The weather forecast for that day includes a maximum
      temperature of 30.8 °C and a minimum of 23.9 °C, with no
      precipitation expected. Wind speeds may reach up to 14.8 km/h,
      with gusts up to 21.6 km/h. There’s a low precipitation
      probability and good visibility. Therefore, based on the
      weather data, there doesn’t seem to be any immediate indicators
      for a potential launch delay.”

✅ Final Result:
  Goal achieved on first run.
